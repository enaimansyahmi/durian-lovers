                fsnNarrative: "Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine are deepening the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the prices of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs continue to surge. While the value of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar has remained relatively stable in August, severe cash shortages continue to limit economic activity within banks and local markets. During the second week of August, the price of diesel decreased by three percent, compared to the previous week leading to a marginal decrease in prices of main food items. However, it remains 89 percent higher compared to the same time last year, affecting transportation costs. Staple food commodity prices also remain significantly higher compared to the same time last year. The average price of WFP’s basic food basket remains significantly higher (26 percent) compared to the same time last year.",
                wfpNarrative: "The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in regional export bans that continue to hinder WFP’s ability to efficiently procure sufficient food commodities in a timely manner, with long lead times persisting for the delivery of international procured commodities. This is particularly pertinent to WFP’s ability to preposition 150,000 MT of food stock before November 2022, ahead of the 2023 winter season. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFunding constraints have hindered WFP’s ability to continue delivering assistance at scale throughout the summer months (June-September). Consequently, some 8 million people in need of food assistance have been cut from WFP programming, and now risk further deterioration to their food and nutrition security status ahead of the 2023 winter season.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP requires an additional USD 45 million for cash-based transfer operations in 2022. For the third month in a row, WFP increased the transfer value for cash-based assistance to maintain the purchasing power of beneficiaries amid rising inflation and food prices. In July, WFP increased the CBT transfer value for a 100 percent ration from AFG 7,700 to AFG 8,500 (10 percent). In August, WFP increased the CBT transfer value further to 9,900 AFG (16 percent). These changes mean that WFP now requires an additional USD 45 million to maintain its current cash caseload until the end of the year.",

                fsnNarrative: "Bangladesh is facing several simultaneous crises, both as a result of and exacerbated by the global food crisis. The country was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, and was already facing creeping inflation even before the conflict in Ukraine. The annual food inflation rate in Bangladesh declined slightly to 8.2 percent in July 2022, down from the eight-year high of 8.4 percent in June. Annual inflation of non-food products increased to 6.4 percent in July. The continued high food inflation affects the purchasing power and income of the vulnerable populations who spend a larger share of their income on food.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn July 2022, Bangladesh saw the lowest July rain in 41 years and the average maximum temperature was 33.7 degrees Celsius - 2.6 degrees higher than the 30-year average. These unusual weather conditions and increased fertilizer prices may severely affect the upcoming agricultural season, particularly the Aman rice harvest. From mid-August, the Government also imposed countrywide electricity rationing (load-shedding) and raised the price of fuel by up to 51 percent by end August. Together with the foreign exchange crisis and unstable dollar rates, the economy may be seriously impacted, jeopardizing the food security of the most vulnerable.",
                wfpNarrative: "In Cox’s Bazar, high fuel prices affected negotiations with food retailers in June as a result of increased transport costs. In July, vendors for transport services and heavy machinery also began to request price revisions for long-term agreements due to a nationwide increase in fuel prices. Adjusting the existing minimum expenditure basket (MEB) based on the April rate of inflation entails an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.67 per person.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees’ purchasing power under the general food assistance programme: 1) Increase CBT transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor nutrition programmes, the rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants, unless additional donor support is secured. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "In July, the Government sought a USD 4.5 billion loan from IMF to cope with mounting economic pressure (and for balance of payment and budgetary needs). It provided 28 stimulus packages equivalent to USD 23 billion (6.3 percent of GDP), which have benefited a total of 67.4 million people and 118,000 business entities.",

                fsnNarrative: "Since average Cambodian households spend around half of their income on food, rising prices for foods (especially for imports such as vegetable oil and vegetables) and inputs for food production (fuel, fertilizers) may impact on household affordability. The latest survey data (COVID-19 SEIA) shows a deterioration in some food security and nutrition indicators (FCS and FCS-N), particularly among urban populations. Rising prices may also result in lower food production and availability as farming profit is shrinking. Both mechanisms will have adverse effects on household food security and nutrition. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn July, market functionality deteriorated notably, with the Market Functionality Index (MFI) dropping to a record low in 2022. This was driven by a drastic decline in the availability of goods in markets and the predictability of market prices. Similarly, the number of customers visiting markets fell to a new low in 2022. Taken together, these findings indicate a drop in consumer demand.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP, in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) expanded monthly market monitoring from 45 to 58 markets to better capture the impact of the global fuel and food crisis. With prices of fuel and fertilizer set to remain high, food prices will also likely remain high in the short term. Cambodia is weathering a cost-of-living shock that is gradually eroding household purchasing power, as can be seen with declining consumer demand.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe crisis will also likely impact government programmes, and drive down the value of cash transfers due to inflation, especially since current cash values are determined by the previous minimum expenditure baskets (MEB). WFP is working on a new MEB and sector-specific transfer values to provide evidence to increase the cash ration to households.",
                stakeholderNarrative: "UNCT has launched a task force to analyse the effects of the conflict in Ukraine. UNCT has successfully applied to a UN SDG fund to enhance its joint monitoring of the looming cost-of-living crisis in Cambodia. The Government has passed a decree that allows the shortening of petrol price adjustment notice period from 15 to 10 days to reflect international price volatility and maintain stability in fuel supplies. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Government extended its nationwide cash transfer programme for poor and vulnerable households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to the end of September 2022 (which started on 24 June 2020). Over 687,000 households (or 2.7 million people) received a total of USD 683.64 million in cash transfers from 25 June 2020 to 24 May 2022 (Social Protection in Cambodia, 30 May 2022). As of 31 May 2022, 1,834 small and medium sized enterprises (SME) received a total of USD 221 million in loans from the Government’s SME (small and medium enterprises) Co-financing Scheme Phase II.

                fsnNarrative: "DPRK’s food security and nutrition are affected by the complex combination of a lack of cultivable land surface, recurrent and severe natural hazards and a shortage of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. Since February 2020, the borders have been closed, resulting in the near suspension of food imports. This is likely to cause excessive consumption of national food reserves and pose potential threats to food security. DPRK imports fertilizers from China – the high prices and tight market supply are likely to negatively impact the crop plantation and production for both early and main crops of 2022.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nRice and corn are staple foods in DPRK. According to Asiapress, rice prices continue to increase, with a 21 percent year-on-year increase. This is likely to reduce household purchasing power, particularly the ability of vulnerable households to afford a healthy diet and cover other essential needs. Although corn prices saw a slight year-on-year decrease by 10 percent in early August, they were 52 percent higher than before COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Fuel prices in August 2022 have tripled compared to August last year. The increased fuel prices are likely to impact DPRK’s economic development, agricultural production and product transportation, which may reduce people’s mobility and access to markets, especially in remote areas, and disrupt livelihoods. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn August, DPR Korea’s local currency (won) depreciated by 38 percent against the USD, and 42 percent against the Chinese Yuan compared to last year, which will increase the country's import bills and domestic prices. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is no definitive data available on the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and global economic instability on DPRK’s food security. ",
                wfpNarrative: "Borders to DPRK have been fully closed since February 2020 following COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the compounding challenges of movement restrictions and the prolonged border closures, WFP operation is temporarily suspended, and food purchases are on hold. WFP distributed the last of its in-country stocks until these were depleted in April 2021. A resumption plan has been drafted to ensure readiness and a smooth restart of the operation as soon as borders reopen. In DPRK, WFP’s main modality is in-kind food distributions. With the current available resources, the CO’s purchasing power for food commodities will be significantly reduced. In addition, the growth of fuel prices will also increase the cost of WFP food transportation. The global food crisis could delay food procurement and shipment (lead time for international procurement are estimated to be 4-8 months, subject to commodity types).",
                stakeholderNarrative: "UN agencies, including WFP, have prepared the 2022 response plan in DPRK to ensure well-coordinated responses when DPRK’s border reopens. Food security and nutrition is one of the main priority areas. The government public distribution system (PDS) is a large social protection programme. However, since August 2021, data on PDS rations has not been updated by the local authority.  ",

                fsnNarrative: "Amidst global disruptions fuelled by the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, Indonesia has managed to maintain its economic performance. In the second quarter of 2022, the country’s economy grew by 5.44 percent on a yearly basis (YoY) and was 5 percent higher than the first quarter. Household consumption - the largest expenditure share of Indonesia’s GDP - grew by 5.51 percent, indicating a continuous recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household purchasing power and spending.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn July, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) reported annual inflation at 4.94 percent, higher compared to June which stood at 4.35 percent. The inflation also exceeded the second revised inflation projection (4.6 percent) by the Bank of Indonesia. The volatility of food prices – especially chilies and shallot – remained the key driver of inflation in July. Both commodities have been affected by adverse weather conditions, which disrupted domestic supplies causing prices to increase and food inflation to rise.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe price of shallot and chilies in July saw the highest jump, compared to both March 2022 and July 2021. Meanwhile, the price of vegetable oil has declined since May, but is still higher compared to July 2021 and the government ceiling price.\r\nAs the war in Ukraine has driven up the global price of wheat, Indonesia as a net wheat importer, recorded a moderate rising price of wheat flour in July 2022, +10% compared to March and +18% YoY.

                stakeholderNarrative: "On 12 March 2022, the Government adopted an anti-crisis plan of KGS 126 billion (USD 1.58 billion), which includes subsidies for agriculture credits, land tax exemptions, wheat grain and flour import tax exemptions, bans on the export of basic food commodities, a nationwide programme of paid public works “Meken Chakyrygy” to provide temporary employment for hundreds of thousands of people, and increase social benefits and salaries of employees such as social workers. The Government is scaling up the ‘Social contract’ programme from the state budget and World Bank’s support as a new poverty graduation model.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo stabilize domestic food prices, the Government banned the export of wheat, wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, eggs and feed crops from the Kyrgyz Republic to other countries outside the EAEU during February-August 2022.

                fsnNarrative: "Rising international oil prices and a plummeting currency are driving up the cost of imports.  In addition, households are likely to experience some deterioration in their diets and food security that is normally associated with the lean season.  This has serious implications on the food security situation of vulnerable households given their weak purchasing power, poor availability of imported goods, and stagnant salaries for civil servants. In addition, the record depreciation of the Lao Kip against the US dollar and the Thai baht are exacerbating inflation levels in Lao PDR and undercutting purchasing power, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of households’ diets. Such conditions have left about 65 percent of households experiencing some level of food insecurity (FIES) during the period of April-May according to a World Bank assessment. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to the 5Fs assessment conducted by Rome-based agencies (FAO/IFAD/WFP) about 20 percent of the farmers were unable to plant rice on time due to high fuel prices and shortages, especially in remote locations. With the poor cultivation across households, a decrease in in household food security is expected especially among vulnerable households in the rural areas.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to the Bank of Lao PDR, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Lao PDR increased to 148.90 points in July from 144.50 points in June 2022. With 2016 being the base year where a 100 percent CPI was reached. The rise in the CPI is a sign that consumer prices are increasing. Based on the Bank of the Laos PDR data, prices have increased by 20% since the beginning of the year (December – June).",
                wfpNarrative: "As a result of the crisis, WFP’s procurement of fortified cooking oil for school feeding was delayed. Given the crisis’ impacts on food and fuel prices, WFP is updating the Minimum Expenditure Basket to better inform needs and transfer values. WFP is setting up a food security monitoring system through mVAM which is likely to target both rural and urban dwellers. In addition to the mVAM, WFP is also collecting market prices. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn terms of direct response, WFP will consider providing additional assistance to the national school feeding programme as well as build community resilience to climate and other shocks through establishing community safety nets and the provision of livelihood grants for agriculture. Should the situation deteriorate and there arise a need for emergency food assistance, WFP has secured resources for both in-kind and cash-based transfers (CBT) to respond to possible shocks/disasters. This includes 1,700 MT of in-kind rice which could provide temporary relief to approximately 20,000 to 25,000 beneficiaries in 2022-2023, plus a high probability of an additional 1,300 MT of rice for 2023-2024. This also includes USD 200,000 to support a potential small-scale CBT response. ",

WFP’s July Market Price update found that while prices remained stable compared to June, the year-on-year increase was significant (34 percent). It is anticipated that rising fuel prices and fuel shortages experienced in August will lead to higher prices in September. Increases in fuel prices results in rising transport costs– a key driver of increasing retail food prices. Rising fertilizer prices could also drive food prices higher; while Myanmar mainly imports fertilizers from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizers in Myanmar.",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP continues to monitor the costs of food and fuel on a monthly basis, and work with partners to identify potential activity adaptations. Based on WFP’s regular market monitor, WFP is increasing the monthly transfer values for select townships in Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states from the end of August. The increases will cost an additional USD 340,000 per month.  As for in-kind distributions, WFP released a tender to identify local suppliers that can reserve a one-month fuel supplies for relief operations. This is in response to rising fuel prices and shortages impacting supply chains across the country. In areas where local suppliers are unable to reserve fuel stocks, WFP may acquire fuel storage tanks to reduce the risk of pipeline breaks due to limited fuel access. WFP also continues to adapt its programming, taking into account the longer lead time needed for the procurement of food and nutrition rations. Additional funding or potential ration cuts for relief assistance may be required if WFP has to resort to international procurement of rice and other commodities at a higher cost. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "WFP Myanmar is not partnering with the de facto authorities on programming. The Myanmar Food Security Cluster, co-led by WFP, FAO and Mercy Corps, continues to monitor food security in the country. Data collection for the fourth round of the WFP/FAO food security assessment is underway. The results will inform the 2023 Humanitarian Needs Overview and the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan. Earlier research conducted by the Cluster highlighted the difficulty to separate the impact of the Ukraine conflict from the ongoing impacts of the military takeover in February 2021 and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cluster estimated up to 40 percent increase in costs. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers. If so, it will likely be even more difficult for them to implement food security initiatives without adequate staff support.",

Prices of rice, wheat flour and some fruit continued to increase, while prices of pulses, soybean oil and some vegetables decreased. Overall, the cost of the food basket continued to increase, by 11 percent in July 2022 compared to April 2022. The inflation rate was at 8 percent in July 2022, year-on-year. Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the indirect impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal’s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; while a continued increase in transportation costs were reported by majority of traders. Export bans imposed by India, including on wheat and sugar, are also increasing prices and having knock-on effects, for example on the cost of poultry and eggs. The early and above average 2022 monsoon season will also likely contribute to increased food insecurity along with rising prices.",
                wfpNarrative: "The immediate impact on WFP operations include delays in procurement and increases in the cost of operations, constraining WFP’s ability to respond.

Samoa and Tonga have shown a slow but steady decline in food security since the second quarter of 2021, with an increasing number of households not being able to meet an acceptable level of food consumption. A critical concern is the increase in negative coping strategies that is being identified in all countries during the second half of 2022 (pending results from Tonga).\r\n<br><br>\r\nOne of the Pacific countries that WFP is not monitoring through mVAM, the Solomon Islands, is of particular concern, with a high level of food insecurity, high financial vulnerability and low levels of income.",

                fsnNarrative: "2022 has been an exceptionally challenging year for Pakistan which is facing one of its worst flooding events, after already reeling from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as political and socioeconomic turmoil. \r\n<br><br>\r\nRegional supply chain disruptions linked to the conflict in Ukraine resulted in persistently soaring food and fuel prices. In 2022, the Pakistani Rupee (PKR) value plunged by 47 percent – among the worst performing currencies globally (ranking below the Sri Lankan currency with a 94 percent decline). Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 4.35 percent in July 2022 year-on-year. CPI food inflation in July 2022 increased by 24.93 percent year-on-year. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis situation is exacerbated further by severe rains and unprecedented flooding in August. The Government of Pakistan declared a national emergency on 26 August, following widespread devastation affecting 33 million people in 116 districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Punjab and Sindh. The floods have incurred huge damages and losses to the food security and agriculture sector. The impact is particularly severe in Balochistan and Sindh provinces, which is most likely to affect the already highly food-insecure situation in the vulnerable districts, and the situation will further worsen due to ongoing rains.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAn Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis was conducted in Pakistan in July 2022 to analyse the acute food insecurity situation in 28 vulnerable districts of Balochistan, KP, and Sindh provinces. It was found that around 5.96 million people (30 percent of the rural population) are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) between July and November 2022, while 7.2 million people (36 percent of the rural population) between December 2022 and March 2023 are projected to be in IPC Phase 3. Key drivers of acute food insecurity include:\r\na) high prices (food and non-food prices) caused by the conflict in Ukraine; b) climatic conditions (drought conditions/inadequate rainfall/heatwave, monsoon rains/flooding); c) reduced food production; and d) livestock diseases and deaths. ",
                wfpNarrative: "Under general food distributions, the availability of fortified vegetable oil in WFP’s standard food basket was temporarily affected by supply chain disruptions following the onset of the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile, rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements under WFP’s CBT programmes. Currently, prices of internationally procured commodities have stabilized, and WFP operations are no longer facing supply disruptions. However, soaring food prices along with supply disruptions and food shortages caused by the recent monsoon flooding are likely to have an adverse impact on the value of cash disbursed and the cost of locally procured commodities.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf the situation continues to deteriorate, imports of wheat may be required to prevent pipeline break. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP’s food basket in Pakistan as well. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTo complement government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for highly vulnerable groups. This will be done through cash assistance or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities – particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support). \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn response to the flood emergency, WFP supported 168,847 flood-affected people in Balochistan with general food distributions and livelihoods support as of 27 August 2022. WFP aims to reach 950,000 people in IPC phases 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency) in 59 flood-affected districts, of which around 250,000 people are estimated to be in IPC 4. Of these, based on resource availability, WFP is initially planning to reach 500,000 people in Balochistan and Sindh through food assistance and cash-based transfers. WFP is also planning to establish a logistics augmentation unit to work with the National Disaster Management Authority to help with storage, management, and dispatch of relief items.  ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "The Government’s Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) Kafalat social safety net programme currently covers 7.3 million people with a monthly stipend of PKR 2,000 per household. The Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further mitigate the impact on fuel price hikes, the Government announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (USD 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries (7.3 million) would receive a monthly top-up of PKR 2,000 (USD 9.7). In response to the flood emergency, the Government plans for a one-off cash payment of PKR 25,000 (USD 114) per household to the flood-affected families. In addition, the World Bank agreed to provide a contribution of USD 150 million, which is expected to expand the BISP to cover those not currently registered under the BISP. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTo maintain current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity, WFP continues its engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest IPC information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security.  \r\nIn end August, the Ministry of Finance announced the approval of a USD 1.17 billion bailout package from the IMF to avert near-term default. The fund will be key to stabilize the economy, in view of surging energy costs which eroded Pakistan’s foreign-exchange reserves and the second-fastest inflation in Asia.",

                fsnNarrative: "The impact of the war in Ukraine pushed global energy and commodity prices to record highs, spilling over to domestic inflation in the Philippines. Headline inflation in July 2022 further increased to 6.4 percent, the highest recorded inflation since October 2018 (PSA). The upwards trend is caused by the higher annual growth in food and non-alcoholic beverages. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Philippines recorded a widening trade deficit in July 2022, contributing to the depreciation of the currency. This trend has a negative impact on imports and purchasing power of Filipinos, making imported goods such as fertilizers, fuel, and food extremely expensive – and eventually pushing local food prices up. In parallel, salary increases are not keeping pace with inflation with inflation-adjusted wages being lower than their respective current salaries in July 2022.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe rise in the overall cost of living and reduction in the affordability of basic commodities translates into more poor families in the country. The national Social Weather Survey of June 2022 found that 48 percent of Filipino families rated themselves as Poor (accounting for 12.2 million families), from 43 percent in April 2022. The survey also found that 74 percent of families feel Food-Poor (8.7 million) or Borderline Food-Poor (4.7 million). \r\n<br><br>\r\nBased on WFP’s market monitoring in Typhoon Odette-affected provinces, the cost of a typical food basket increased to USD 144 in June 2022, from USD 123 in January 2022 – a 17 percent increase. More than half (55 percent) of traders interviewed for the market assessment reported that the average prices of key commodities sold in July 2022 remained the same, while 39 percent said prices further increased. To cope with the surge in prices, nearly 60 percent of traders noted that the customers started buying fewer goods compared to usual and buying cheaper or less preferred goods.",
                wfpNarrative: "To monitor the impact of the global food, energy and financial crisis, WFP has scaled up its monitoring and analysis activities in the Philippines. In June, WFP initiated bi-monthly market monitoring. WFP is collecting data in the Typhoon Odette-affected provinces of Bohol, Dinagat Islands, Southern Leyte, and Surigao del Norte. With support from the Joint SDG fund, WFP, FAO and ILO are also preparing to launch household phone surveys in the Philippines to support existing government monitoring and surveillance systems for agriculture, food security, and social protection.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP amended its transport contracts and increased rates by 15 percent. This addresses requests from WFP’s transporters who are facing challenges due to the overall increase in the cost of fuel. ",
                stakeholderNarrative: "In June, Philippine President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that he will head the country's agriculture department as he seeks to revamp the sector amid rising food prices and possible shortages. The Philippines’ Department of Agriculture also called upon FAO to “spearhead another global appeal to various countries to keep unhampered the movement of food and agricultural inputs as part of the global effort to build more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable agriculture and food systems”.",

Of these, at least 66,000 people are severely food insecure. WFP is concerned that these figures could increase drastically without immediate intervention and that the crisis’ impact will be felt beyond 2022. Skyrocketing food costs are making it harder for the population to meet their food needs. About 6.7 million people are not consuming adequate diets and 5.3 million people are reducing the number of meals eaten. \r\n<br><br>\r\nSeveral events (not all directly related to Ukraine) have led to inflation skyrocketing to record highs, driven by rising global food prices, a dwindling currency, and low domestic food production. Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities. The global economic crisis is set to only exert additional pressure on Sri Lanka. ",
                wfpNarrative: "WFP is immediately scaling up operations to reach 3.4 million additional people in 2022 and urgently requires USD 63 million to carry out its lifesaving assistance. WFP has now reached over 19,000 people with cash-based transfers (CBT) since commencing distributions on 15 August. WFP has reached 2,490 pregnant women with value vouchers of LKR 15,000 (USD 40) each to support their food and nutritional needs. In addition to CBT and food vouchers, WFP is in process of importing food commodities  for in-kind distributions for 1.4 million beneficiaries. The food commodities are (expected to arrive between August and November). \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn partnership with the Government, WFP will support 1 million children aged 5 to 10 with school meals. WFP will prioritize vulnerable schools, where the Government’s national school meals programme has been halted due to budget constraints. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWFP is supporting the resumption of Sri Lanka’s Thriposha nutrition programme that provides food fortified with vitamins and minerals to malnourished children under five and pregnant and lactating women.
